About
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Armadillo is the codename for a Strategy RPG by Steve Phillips and George Emond.
It is a tech demo for the time being that may eventually be expanded into a full
game.

It takes inspiration from other Strategy RPGs such as Shining Force II, La 
Pucelle Tactics and the Disgaea series.

All code is written by Steve Phillips and all artwork is by George Emond.

Development Setup
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
To set up a development environment to build and test Armadillo, you will need
Visual Studio and XNA 4.0. You can download Visual C# Express 2010 from
Microsoft's website, as well as XNA Game Studio 4.0. Both are free to use,
although Visual C# Express requires free registration after 30 days.
